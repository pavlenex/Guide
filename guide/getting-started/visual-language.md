Editor's notes

A brief history of bitcoin "branding" and the visual culture around bitcoin.

A good addition would be a summary of the basic brand elements (color, symbol...).

# The visual language of Bitcoin

Since Bitcoin answers to no central authority, there is no single symbol or logo that can visually represent it, though many try. Here are some of the most recognized attempts to create a universal logo for Bitcoin.


### Original symbol

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/satoshi-2010.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/satoshi-2010@2x.png"
   alt-text = "The original Bitcoin symbol from 2010"
   width = 140
   height = 140
   layout = "float-left"
%}

Satoshi Nakamoto created this lettered golden coin for the original Bitcoin Core client.

</div>

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/early-bitcoin-core-wallet.jpg"
   alt-text = "Screenshot of an early version of the Bitcoin Core application"
   caption = "The original logo in an early version of the Bitcoin Core wallet."
   width = 640
   height = 300
%}

</div>

### Updated symbol

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/satoshi-update-2010.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/satoshi-update-2010@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Updated version of the Bitcoin symbool"
   width = 140
   height = 140
   layout = "float-left"
%}

On February 24, 2010, Satoshi posted an updated icon that adopted the capital “B” with two vertical lines ([archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20130524055823/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0), [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=64.0)).

</div>

### Update by Bitboy

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/bitboy-2011.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/bitboy-2011@2x.png"
   alt-text = "A new version of the Bitcoin symbol that we still use today"
   width = 140
   height = 140
   layout = "float-left"
%}

On November 1, 2010, a user named bitboy proposed a new icon and set of promotional graphics on the Bitcointalk forum ([archive.org](https://web.archive.org/web/20130524191250/https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0), [bitcointalk.org](https://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=1631.0)). This iteration added a flat style, the hex color #F7931A, and a 14-degree rotation of the B. This interpretation of the bitcoin logo is still ubiquitous today.

</div>

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/bitboy-promotional-graphics.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/bitboy-promotional-graphics@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Promotional Bitcoin graphics like buttons and stickers"
   caption = "Promotional graphics created by bitboy."
   width = 573
   height = 567

</div>

### The Unicode symbol

<div class="center" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/unicode-symbol.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/unicode-symbol@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Bitcoin unicode symbol"
   width = 140
   height = 140
   layout = "float-left"
%}

The Unicode symbol for Bitcoin (₿) was introduced in [Unicode 10.0.0](http://www.unicode.org/versions/Unicode10.0.0/) on June 20, 2017. This important step established Bitcoin as a currency symbol alongside the US Dollar ($), Euro (€), and others. As of mid-2021, few fonts support the symbol.

</div>

## Beyond the symbol

Bitcoin’s permissionless, decentralized, and open nature has led to practically endless representations not just of the logo but of the character and ethos of the community.

### Memes

From moon Lambos to the price rollercoaster, there’s a meme for practically every situation. Certain graphics, stories, jokes, and ideas have won out over others to become recognizable avatars of the community and its personality.

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/memes.jpg"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/memes@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "Examples of popular bitcoin memes"
   caption = "References from top left to bottom right, <a href='http://www.brainlesstales.com/bitcoin-roller-coaster' target='_blank'>1</a>, <a href='https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/1gagle/lol_new_bitcoin_billboard_in_san_jose_honey_badger/' target='_blank'>2</a>, unknown author, <a href='https://medium.com/@paulbars/magic-internet-money-how-a-reddit-ad-made-bitcoin-hit-1000-and-inspired-south-parks-art-b414ec7a5598' target='_blank'>4</a>, unknown author, unknown author."
   width = 800
   height = 421
%}

</div>

### The gold metaphor

Some of the most common representations of bitcoin are based on Satoshi’s original gold coin illustration. This style boldly makes a case for bitcoin as a transactable kind of digital gold, for which additional elements of binary code or electrical circuits are sometimes added. On the other end of the realist spectrum are heavily illustrated coins like those you might find in a video game.

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/metaphors.jpg"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/metaphors@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "Examples of illustrations of bitcoin as a physical coin or gold"
   caption = "References from top left to bottom right, unknown author, <a href='https://www.freepik.com/free-vector/bitcoin-design_2082416.htm' target='_blank'>2</a>, unknown author, unknown author, <a href='https://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=794593' target='_blank'>4</a>, <a href='https://wall.alphacoders.com/big.php?i=939776' target='_blank'>5</a>."
   width = 800
   height = 500
%}

</div>

### Illustrations

Magazines, blogs, and other publications often hire professional illustrators to visualize stores about Bitcoin. Because Bitcoin does not have any official brand style guidelines, they are usually only limited by the illustrator and publisher’s imagination.

<div class="image-gallery" markdown="1">

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/illustrations.jpg"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/illustrations@2x.jpg"
   alt-text = "Examples of professional illustrations involving bitcoin"
   caption = "References from top left to bottom right, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/66922301/Cryptoshop_Spot' target='_blank'>1</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/16903103/INSIDE-THE-WILD-WORLD-OF-BITCOIN' target='_blank'>2</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/25226745/Bitcoin-Illustration-for-an-internal-corporale-mag' target='_blank'>3</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/55850063/Waiting-for-Bitcoin' target='_blank'>4</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/56839949/The-Bitcoin-Knight' target='_blank'>5</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/58381785/Cryptocurrency' target='_blank'>6</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/59591697/Miss-Currency' target='_blank'>7</a>, <a href='https://www.behance.net/gallery/59920255/WIRED-Backchannel-The-Future-of-Bitcoin' target='_blank'>8</a>, <a href='https://mercuryo.io' target='_blank'>9</a>, <a href='' target='_blank'>10</a>, <a href='https://cash.app/bitcoin' target='_blank'>11</a>."
   width = 800
   height = 608
%}

</div>

## The expression scale

Think about Bitcoin’s visual language as a scale that ranges from muted to highly expressive. These images look very different, but they all capture Bitcoin in some way. As the identity of Bitcoin is public and community-owned, all these representations are equally valid. This provides enormous creative freedom to designers and illustrators with their own visions.

{% include image.html
   image = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/expression-scale.png"
   retina = "/assets/images/guide/getting-started/visual-language/expression-scale@2x.png"
   alt-text = "Sequence of images showing the bitcoin symbol illustrated in mininimal and expressive ways"
   caption = ""
   width = 800
   height = 133
%}

In digital product design, there are times when a minimally expressive approach is what’s needed. For example, when a user makes a transaction, we want them to focus. At other times, illustrations and stronger visual elements are more appropriate, and this is where we can take advantage of the creative freedom Bitcoin affords.

As you have seen, Bitcoin is shaped by its user base. Now, let's go under the hood with the [technology primer]({{ '/guide/getting-started/technology-primer/' | relative_url }}).
